🏃‍♂️ RUNNING MARATHON – Supervised ML Regression Project
=========================================================

📌 1) Overview
This project leverages Supervised Machine Learning (Regression) to predict a runner’s marathon finishing time.
The main objective is to estimate total race time or pace (min/km) using important personal attributes and training-related indicators.
