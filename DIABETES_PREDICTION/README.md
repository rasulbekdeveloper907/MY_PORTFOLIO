# 🏥 Diabetes Prediction  

A **Machine Learning** project that predicts whether a person has **Diabetes** based on medical diagnostic data using **classification models**.  
This project demonstrates **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation** with a focus on **healthcare applications**.

## 📌 What is Diabetes?  

**Diabetes Mellitus** is a chronic medical condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar (glucose).  
Early detection using predictive models can:  

- 📢 **Warn patients earlier**  
- 🏥 **Assist doctors in decision-making**  
- 🌍 **Reduce long-term healthcare costs**  

The dataset includes diagnostic measurements such as:  

- **Pregnancies**  
- **Glucose Level**  
- **Blood Pressure**  
- **Skin Thickness**  
- **Insulin Level**  
- **BMI** (Body Mass Index)  
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**  
- **Age**  

The **Outcome** column is the target variable:  
- `0` → Non-Diabetic  
- `1` → Diabetic

## 🎯 Project Objective  

To build a **classification model** capable of predicting whether a patient is diabetic, enabling:  

- 🩺 **Early diagnosis support**  
- 📊 **Preventive healthcare measures**  
- 🧪 **Data-driven decision making in medicine**

## 🔍 Approach & Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning  
- Load dataset: `diabetes.csv`  
- Handle missing values and outliers.  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize feature distributions.  
- Compute **correlation matrix** to identify strong predictors.  

### 3️⃣ Feature Selection & Engineering  
- Select important medical features.  
- Optional: Create derived features (e.g., BMI categories, age groups).  

### 4️⃣ Model Training  
- Train/Test split.  
- Models used:  
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Random Forest Classifier**  
  - **XGBoost**  

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation  
Metrics used:  
- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**  
- **ROC-AUC Curve**  

📊 Visualization: **Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve** for performance check.

## 📈 Results & Insights  

- **High ROC-AUC Score:** Indicates strong classification power.  
- **Recall is critical:** Helps reduce false negatives (patients wrongly predicted as non-diabetic).  
- **EDA Observations:** Glucose and BMI are the strongest predictors of diabetes.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  

- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data Processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn, XGBoost** – Machine Learning
